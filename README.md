# The Truth is Out There
## Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript
---
### Overview
In this module, students continued to practice using Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap to create a webpage which displays a data table of all recorded UFO sightings during the year of 2010.  Since the dataset is rather large, an input field was added to allow the user to filter the data by a specific date.

### Moving Forward
One way we could improve on this web page would be to find another source for our ufo sightings which is continously updated with the latest information(for example, The National UFO Reporting Center).  If we could scrape that data and integrate it into our dataset it would really take our dataset to the next level!  

Another potential opportunity for improving our search is the type of user input fields we are using.  It might be more user friendly to use dropdown menus for the states and/or a date range for the dates (shown below).

One final improvement which could be made would be to add a map that shows where the sighting(s) occured  based on the user criteria - Zillow-style!
